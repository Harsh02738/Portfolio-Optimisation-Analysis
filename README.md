# 📈 SAPM Project – Portfolio Optimization & Analysis

This project is a continuation of Security Analysis and Portfolio Management (SAPM) and focuses on **portfolio construction, optimization, and performance evaluation** using modern portfolio theory. It covers 5 selected stocks, risk-return tradeoffs, and how they compare to the market.

## 📁 Sheets Overview

### 🔹 Individual Stock Analysis

Each of the following stocks is analyzed across two sheets:

- **CAPL**
- **ICICI**
- **TATA Motors**
- **NALWA**
- **TIPS MUSIC**

Each stock includes:
- Daily return calculations
- Average return
- Standard deviation (risk)
- Beta (if applicable)
- Visualization of trends

### 📊 Portfolio Construction

#### 🔸 `Covarience Matrix`
- Contains pairwise covariances of stock returns.
- Used as input to optimize portfolio variance.

#### 🔸 `Weighted Portfolio`
- Calculates expected return and risk for a custom-weighted portfolio.
- Helps in understanding how diversification affects total risk.

#### 🔸 `Sharpe Ratio`
- Computation of risk-adjusted return using:
  \[
  \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}
  \]
  where \( R_p \) is portfolio return, \( R_f \) is risk-free rate, and \( \sigma_p \) is portfolio standard deviation.

#### 🔸 `Markowitz Frontier`
- Used to identify the **efficient frontier** – the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk.

### 📈 `Comparision with Market Portfolio`

- Benchmarks the custom portfolio against the market portfolio.
- Provides insights on:
  - Outperformance or underperformance
  - Relative risk exposure
  - CAPM-based theoretical return
